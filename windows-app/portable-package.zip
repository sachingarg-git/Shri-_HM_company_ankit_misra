# This would be a compiled package, but since we can't actually compile .NET here,
# I'm providing the source structure that will be compiled when you run compile-for-user.bat

# Package Contents After Compilation:
# - TallySync.exe (Self-contained executable ~80-100MB)
# - README.txt (User documentation)
# - Setup-Guide.txt (Installation instructions)
# - Run-TallySync.bat (Quick launcher)
# - Install-TallySync.bat (System installer)

# To get the compiled version:
# 1. Copy the windows-app folder to a Windows machine
# 2. Run compile-for-user.bat as Administrator
# 3. The dist folder will contain all compiled files
