Create a printable Sales Order page that looks the same in layout and style as the sample image.
Do not copy any text from the image. Use my own data. The page must pull details for the selected client from the database and fill every field automatically.

Page style & look

Clean, professional, single A4 page.

Top header with my company logo on the left and company name + address + contact on the right.

Main title centered: “Sales Order” in bold. Use a red accent color for titles and table headers, black for normal text, light gray for divider lines.

Consistent spacing, neat borders, and equal padding inside all boxes.

Ready for print and PDF download, with proper margins and page break if the items table is long.

If any field is missing, show a blank line instead of an error.

Keep the exact layout and styling consistent every time.
